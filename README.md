# FilePermission

A little Project of mine to change file permissions of existing files or creating new ones with specific permissions.
Written in C, build with CMake.

As you can see, you'll have the option of either editing your existing File and adding new Permissions to it or taking 
some away or you create a whole new file and add the permissions to it.

When you want to add the permission bits, exp. File Foo.txt is supposed to have chmod 147. Then your Input should look like 1 6 789 to add those permissions to the file.

Have fun with it, request a pull or file an issue if you find something.
